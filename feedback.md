Please review [Inline Code Comments](https://github.com/nolds9/Project3/compare/json_backend_concept...feedback) prefixed with my initials `NHO`

Notes:
- Directory structure
  - Would like to see more natural separation of concerns
    - i.e there's a `db` directory with all relevant files, like `seeds.json`, `schema.js`
    - `models.js` is renamed to `city.js` and moved to `models` directory
    - Break up `index.js`
    - Break up `script.js`
